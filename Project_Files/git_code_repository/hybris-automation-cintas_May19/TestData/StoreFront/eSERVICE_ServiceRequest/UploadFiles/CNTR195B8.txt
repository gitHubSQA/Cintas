Upload file with new Service Request. Allow the user to select a file from their computer and attach it to a Service Request. This should be sent along with the service request and saved somewhere so that it is linked to the ticket in the Interaction Center. This can be done when creating a new Service Request (CNTR-195, this story) or when updating an existing service request with a new comment (CNTR-1299).
